## Features

- **Search & Filtering:** Quick product search with suggestions. Filter products by categories, and price range (interactive slider) to find items easily.  
- **Shopping Cart:** Add products to a cart with selected quantities and sizes. Update item quantities or remove items. Cart persistently shows total price and updates as changes are made.  
- **Wishlist:** Save favorite products to a wishlist for future viewing or purchase. Logged-in users can add or remove items from their personal wishlist.  
- **User Authentication:** Secure user accounts with Google OAuth via NextAuth. Users can sign in with their Google account to manage their cart, wishlist, and orders.  
- **Checkout & Payment:** A step-by-step checkout process collects shipping details and allows users to place orders. Integrated **Razorpay** payment gateway for processing credit/debit card or UPI payments. Payments are verified securely before order confirmation.  
- **Order Management:** After checkout, orders are saved in the system. Users can view their order history in a "Your Orders" section, which shows order details and current status. Real-time shipping status updates are fetched via the **Shiprocket** API integration, and users can even cancel orders that havenâ€™t shipped.  
- **Admin Panel (Order Administration):** *(Planned)* Basic admin functionality to manage orders. An authorized admin can update order statuses (e.g., mark as Shipped or Delivered) to keep customers informed. (This is facilitated by a protected API endpoint for updating order status.)  
- **Responsive UI & UX:** Mobile-friendly and responsive design. Includes features like a sliding image banner on the homepage, a sticky navigation bar with dropdown menus, and toast notifications (via React-Toastify) for feedback on actions (e.g., item added to cart, order placed successfully).  
- **Inventory Tracking:** Product stock is tracked per size. The system ensures accurate availability display and can prevent ordering out-of-stock items.
